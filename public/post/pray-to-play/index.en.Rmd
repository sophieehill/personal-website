Following on from the original [My Little Crony](https://www.sophie-e-hill.com/post/my-little-crony/) map, this visualization zooms in on the government contracts being awarded to firms **linked to an Evangelical Christian sect**: the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

Investigative reporting by [Byline Times](https://bylinetimes.com/2020/11/18/plymouth-exclusive-brethren-ppe-contracts-uk-government/) and the non-profit group [All the Citizens](https://twitter.com/allthecitizens/status/1329069371709222913?s=20) has uncovered **21 UK companies** that appear to have links to the Plymouth Brethren, which have won at least **49 Covid-related government contracts** since March, **worth as much as Â£1.1 billion**.
